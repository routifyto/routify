# Open-source AI Gateway
#### Route your LLM requests to different providers with no code changes

</div>

Routify streamlines chat completion requests to 150+ open & closed source models with a unified API and easy-to-use UI. It supports caching, fallbacks, retries, timeouts, loadbalancing, transformations, logging and can be self-hosted.

- **Fast**: Routify is built on top of .NET8 and is designed to be fast and efficient.
- **Easy to use**: Routify provides an easy-to-use interface where you can manage all requests and responses.
- **Schema mapping**: Routify can map requests and responses to different provider schemas.
- **Observability**: Routify provides observability features to help you monitor your AI requests.
- **Cost control**: Routify can help you control costs by estimating the cost of each request and applying real-time limits.
- **Load balancing**: Routify can load balance requests across multiple providers.
- **Failover**: Routify can automatically failover to a different provider if the primary provider is down.
- **Multi tenant**: Routify is multi tenant by default, allowing you to use the same deployment for different applications or environments.

## How it works

Routify uses routes which allow you to have different behavior and logic for different use cases. Each route is defined by a path and can have one or more providers to proxy the requests.

For example, you can have a route that matches `/openai` to proxy requests to the OpenAI API and another route that matches `/anthropic` to proxy requests to the Anthropic API. Or you can simply have the path `v1/chat/completion` for drop-in replacement of OpenAI requests (just a domain change and an extra header).

Each route has a schema that defines which provider schema to use for the route. This will determine the structure of the request and response objects. You can use the OpenAI schema for request and response body, but have the request proxied to the Anthropic API or any other provider. Routify automatically maps the common fields between different providers. This allows you to switch providers without changing your application code.

Also you can override request parameters, such as `system prompt`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, etc. for each provider, through the user interface, on runtime.

## Test with Routify cloud

- Create an account and app at [cloud.routify.to](https://cloud.routify.to)
- Create a route, for example: `v1/chat/completion` if you are using OpenAI
- Add the OpenAI provider and the necessary credentials
- Make the request to Routify cloud gateway

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://gateway.routify.to/v1/chat/completions \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ROUTIFY_API_KEY}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header 'routify-app: {ROUTIFY_APP_ID}' \
```

## Components

- **Postgres** - main database for configurations and logs
- **Redis** - in memory database for caching and cost limits

## Self-hosting

### Docker Compose

To run Routify using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/routify.git
   cd routify
   ```

2. Run the following command to start all services:
   ```
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure_password JWT_SECRET=your_secret JWT_ISSUER=your_issuer JWT_AUDIENCE=your_audience GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_token ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_key GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id docker-compose up
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your actual values.

3. Access the Routify UI at `http://localhost:3000`

For more detailed information about the Docker Compose setup, refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of the project.
