# Consumers

Routify allows you to create custom consumers which allows you to track costs and usage for different consumers. You can also apply custom cost limitations for customers.

Consumers are created through the interface or by using the API. When making a request you need to add a `routify-consumer` to the request headers. This will allow Routify to track the usage and costs for that consumer. The header value can be the consumer id generated by Routify or a custom alias (which can be an external id).
